One of the advantages of using unsupervised machine learning algorithms is that they don't need labeled data; thus, ultimately saving higher labeling costs for an organization. However, the computational complexity and large input space put these algorithms into the category of non-testable programs, which also suffer from the oracle problem. One popular testing approach, borrowed from the Software Engineering (SE) domain is the Metamorphic Testing (MT) technique that has been proven to be an effective approach in alleviating the oracle problem in testing such non-testable programs. We take advantage of this MT approach and make some insightful contributions. This repo contains all the code, the MRs implementation, and the results analysis/reasoning.
